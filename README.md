            DB_PORT=3306

    
    Set your database name, username, and password:

      DB_DATABASE=your-database-name
      DB_USERNAME=database-username
      DB_PASSWORD=database-password


3. **Run Migrations:**
    Run the following commands to migrate the database:

    ```bash
      php artisan migrate

4. **Seed the Database:**
    Seed the database with sample data by running:    
    ```bash
        php artisan db:seed --class="BookSeeder"

5. **Update Dependencies:**
    Ensure your Composer dependencies are up to date:
